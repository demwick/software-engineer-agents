# Regression: the two-file marker scheme must produce the same retry-
# then-give-up behavior as the v1 single-file scheme. Walks the hook
# through first failure, second failure, and the give-up branch with
# stop_hook_active=true. Asserts .verify-attempts is incremented and
# cleared correctly at every step, and that the marker file and counter
# file are both removed on the terminal give-up.
