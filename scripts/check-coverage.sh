# check-coverage.sh — compare plan requirements against progress coverage.
#
# Usage: check-coverage.sh <plan.md> <progress.json>
#
# Parses criterion ids (Rx.y) from the plan, reads .completed_tasks[].covered[]
# from progress.json, and emits JSON:
#
#   {"covered": [...], "uncovered": [...], "errors": [...]}
#
# - covered:   criteria present in both plan and progress
# - uncovered: plan criteria not yet covered by any completed task
# - errors:    progress references unknown criteria (not defined in plan)
#
