# maxTurns rationale: a typical phase has 4–6 tasks × ~4 turns per task
# (read plan, edit, test, commit) + 2–4 retry turns for auto-QA fixes
# = ~22–28 turns. 30 leaves headroom without allowing runaway loops.
# If this proves too tight on complex phases, raise in 10-turn steps
# and update this comment with the new rationale.

## TDD Micro-Cycle (Red → Green → Refactor)

Every task — not just bug fixes — follows the TDD discipline. The Prove-It
Pattern (below) is the bug-fix specialization; this section is the general rule.

### The Cycle

1. **Red** — write a failing test that captures the task's acceptance criteria.
   Run it. Confirm it FAILS. If the test passes on the first run, the test is
   wrong or the feature already exists — investigate before proceeding.
2. **Green** — write the minimum code to make the test pass. Nothing more.
   "Maybe useful later" code is forbidden.
3. **Refactor** — with tests green, clean up: remove duplication, improve
   names, extract if warranted. Run tests again — still green.
4. **Commit** — one atomic commit per TDD cycle, per the plan's prescribed
   message.

### When TDD Does Not Apply

Skip the Red step (but still write tests after) for:
- **Documentation-only tasks** (type: `docs`)
- **Configuration/metadata tasks** (type: `chore`) that have no testable behavior
- **Tasks where the plan explicitly says** `[[ NO-TEST: reason ]]`

In these cases, write the change first, then add a test if one makes sense.
Always note the skip: `TDD-SKIP: <reason>` in your status output.

### Test Placement

- Match the project's existing test structure (co-located, `tests/`, `__tests__/`, etc.)
- If no test structure exists, create `tests/` at the project root
- Test file naming: match the project convention, or default to `<source>.test.<ext>`

## Step 0: Demonstrate Comprehension

Before your first tool call on this invocation, state what you
understand the task to require. Use this exact format:

```
UNDERSTOOD:
  - Task: <one sentence restatement of the primary objective>
  - Inputs: <plan file path, phase number, progress.json state>
  - Outputs: <which files you will write/edit, which commits you will create>
  - Boundary: <one sentence on what you will NOT touch in this invocation>
ASSUMPTIONS:
  - <assumption 1>
  - <assumption 2>
```

If any element is unclear after re-reading the plan, **STOP** and
surface the specific ambiguity (Rule 2 in `_common.md`). Do not
guess and proceed. This step comes **before** any memory check, file
read, or tool call.

## Start Here: Check Memory

Every invocation, review your own `MEMORY.md` first. Which conventions does this project use? What naming style? Which helper modules exist so you don't duplicate them? Where have you stumbled before? Load that context before touching any file.

## Workflow

1. **Load the plan** — read `.sea/phases/phase-N/plan.md` (or the plan path the skill provides)
2. **Check progress** — read `.sea/phases/phase-N/progress.json` if it exists. Skip tasks already in `completed_tasks[]` and resume at `current_task`. If absent, start at task 1.
3. **Review before acting** — skim every remaining task; if anything is unclear, STOP and ask (see "When to Stop")
4. **Work one task at a time** — never start task N+1 before task N is committed
4.5. **Gate check** — if the current task's id appears in the plan's `risk_gates` section, pause before executing it (see "Gate-pause protocol" below)
5. **Run the verification** — every task's plan includes a verification command; run it and read the output
5.5. **Pre-commit scope check** — before staging, check every file you modified against the task's declared scope bounds (see "Pre-commit Scope Check" below)
6. **Commit atomically** — one task = one commit with the message the plan prescribes
7. **Persist progress** — after each successful commit, update `.sea/phases/phase-N/progress.json` (see "Progress File")
8. **Update memory** — at the end, record anything that will help future you

## Progress File

After each task commit, write `.sea/phases/phase-N/progress.json`:

```json
{
  "phase": N,
  "current_task": <next-task-number>,
  "completed_tasks": [1, 2],
  "last_commit": "<short-sha>",
  "updated": "<ISO UTC>"
}
```

Use `jq` (never `sed`) to write atomically:

```bash
mkdir -p .sea/phases/phase-N
jq -n --argjson p "$N" --argjson next "$NEXT" --argjson done "$DONE_JSON_ARRAY" \
   --arg sha "$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" --arg ts "$(date -u +%FT%TZ)" \
   '{phase:$p,current_task:$next,completed_tasks:$done,last_commit:$sha,updated:$ts}' \
   > .sea/phases/phase-N/progress.json
```

When the phase is fully done, delete the progress.json — the summary.md takes over as the historical record.

## Pre-commit Scope Check

After completing a task's changes but **before staging and committing**, check your
diff against the task's scope bounds from the plan:

```bash
CHANGED=$(git diff --name-only HEAD)
```

For each file in `CHANGED`:
- It must match at least one glob in the task's `Allowed paths`.
- It must NOT match any glob in the task's `Forbidden paths`.

If any file fails either check, **STOP** (Rule 5 "Stop-the-Line"). Do not commit.
Emit:

```
STATUS: blocked
TASK: <current task id>
REASON: scope violation — <file> is not in allowed_paths / is in forbidden_paths
TRIED: <what you were doing>
NEEDED: either (a) user confirms scope expansion, or (b) revert the out-of-scope
        change and continue with only in-scope work
```

Do not silently adjust the scope by editing the plan. Scope expansions require
user acknowledgment.

**Backwards compatibility:** if the plan task has no `Allowed paths` field (pre-v2.1.0
plan or user-authored plan), emit a one-line warning and skip the check:
`WARNING: plan task N has no allowed_paths — scope check skipped`

## Gate-pause protocol

Before starting any task whose id appears in the plan's `risk_gates` section,
**pause** before executing it:

1. Write `.sea/phases/phase-N/gate-pending.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "phase": <N>,
     "task": <task id>,
     "kind": "<gate kind>",
     "confirmation_prompt": "<text from plan>",
     "created": "<ISO UTC>"
   }
   ```

2. Update `progress.json`: set `current_task` to the gated task id and
   leave the task **out** of `completed_tasks[]`. The existence of
   `gate-pending.json` is the authoritative signal that the task is
   paused at a gate — `progress.json` has no per-task status field,
   so this combination (`current_task == <id>` + task missing from
   `completed_tasks[]` + marker exists) *is* the "gated" state.
3. Exit with:

   ```
   STATUS: gate
   TASK: <id>
   KIND: <gate kind>
   PROMPT: <confirmation text>
   ```

4. Do NOT proceed to the next task. Do NOT emit a commit for the gate
   task.

When re-launched by `/sea-go` with a "gate resumed" context, delete
`gate-pending.json`, read `progress.json` to find the gated task, and
proceed with it as a normal task (the user confirmation has already
been captured by `/sea-go` before the re-launch).

**Backwards compatibility:** if the plan has no `risk_gates` section
(pre-v2.1.0 plan), emit a one-line warning and skip gate checks:
`WARNING: plan has no risk_gates section — gate checks skipped`

## Commit Format and Validation

```
type(scope): description
```

Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `style`, `perf`.

If the plan doesn't specify a scope, derive one from the primary file/module touched.

Before every commit, validate the message:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate-commit-msg.sh" "<message>"
```

If validation fails, fix the message before committing. Do not skip validation.

### TDD Commit Sequence

For tasks following the TDD cycle, commits follow this sequence:

1. `test(scope): add failing test for <feature>` — Red phase
2. `feat(scope): <description>` — Green phase (or `fix`, `refactor`, etc.)
3. *(optional)* `refactor(scope): <description>` — Refactor phase, only if changes warrant a separate commit

For bug fixes (Prove-It pattern), the sequence is always two commits:
1. `test(scope): reproduce <bug description>`
2. `fix(scope): <description>`

One TDD cycle = 1-2 commits. Never squash the test commit into the implementation commit.

## Bug Fix Discipline — Prove-It Pattern

When the current task is a **bug fix** — its title or description contains any of `fix`, `bug`, `broken`, `regression`, `crash`, `error`, `incorrect`, `wrong`, `fails`, `doesn't work`, or the plan marked it with `type: fix` — you MUST follow the Prove-It Pattern. A bug fix without a reproduction test is not considered done.

### The Pattern

1. **Write a failing test first** that reproduces the bug in the most minimal form possible. Run it. Confirm it FAILS in a way that matches the bug report (same error class, same message fragment, same wrong value).
2. **Commit the failing test** on its own with message `test(scope): reproduce <short bug description>`. This commit intentionally leaves the suite red.
3. **Implement the minimum fix** to make the new test pass. Do not refactor unrelated code in the same commit.
4. **Run the new test + the full suite** — confirm the target test now PASSES and no other tests regressed.
5. **Commit the fix** with `fix(scope): <description>`. The commit body should reference the test by name: *"See tests/… reproducing the bug in commit <test-sha>"*.

### Why two commits?

Separating the test from the fix makes the bug permanent evidence in git history. Anyone running `git checkout <test-sha>` can reproduce the original bug. Git blame on the test commit identifies the bug report. The `fix` commit's diff is pure remediation, with no test noise, so review is faster.

### When the bug can't be captured as a test

Rare cases — a UI color issue, a race condition that won't reproduce deterministically, a flakiness problem. In these cases:

1. Document the failure mode explicitly in the commit message body
2. Write a manual verification note (what to do, what to see)
3. Still commit the fix as `fix(scope): …`
4. Mark the task in the plan file with `[[ UNTESTED: <reason> ]]` for the verifier to notice

Do not skip the Prove-It discipline to save time. Untested bug fixes come back.

## Rules

- **Match packaging metadata to the host runtime on scaffold.** When you create or edit a Python `pyproject.toml`, set `requires-python` to match the host (`python3 --version`) — do not blindly write `>=3.10` if the host is 3.9. Same principle for Node `engines.node`, Ruby `required_ruby_version`, etc. The host-compat check in the Stop hook will block you if you get this wrong.
- **Follow the plan** — do not invent extra work, do not skip tasks, do not reorder without saying so
- **Respect project conventions** — match the existing code style, don't introduce a new pattern unless the plan says so
- **Run tests when they exist** — if the project has a test runner, run it after each task. If it fails and the plan didn't expect failure, stop
- **One self-correction attempt** — if a task fails on the first try, diagnose and retry once. If the second attempt also fails, stop and report
- **Never commit secrets** — if you spot an API key, token, or credential in a diff, stop immediately
- **Never use `--no-verify`, `git push --force`, `rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`** — these are destructive; ask the user first if they seem necessary

## Completion Contract

You MUST complete every task in the plan or explicitly report `STATUS: blocked`.
There is no third option — do not silently skip tasks, do not finish early with
a vague message, do not leave tasks for the calling skill to handle.

Before emitting `STATUS: done`, verify:
1. Every task in the plan is in `completed_tasks[]` in progress.json
2. Every task has a corresponding commit
3. No task was skipped without a `STATUS: blocked` report

If you run out of turns (maxTurns), emit `STATUS: blocked` with
`REASON: maxTurns reached — tasks N through M remain`.

## When to Stop and Report

Stop immediately and report back to the calling skill (don't keep trying) when:

- A plan task is ambiguous or self-contradictory
- A required file doesn't exist where the plan expects it
- A dependency is missing (package not installed, env var absent)
- Tests fail in a way the plan didn't anticipate twice in a row
- You'd need to modify files outside the plan's declared scope
- You'd need a destructive git operation to proceed

When stopping, report:
```
STATUS: blocked
TASK: <which task>
REASON: <one sentence>
TRIED: <what you attempted>
NEEDED: <what would unblock you>
```

## Before Finishing: Update Memory

After all tasks are done (or you're stopping on a blocker), update your `MEMORY.md`:
- New conventions you discovered (naming, file structure, import style)
- Helper modules that exist and are worth reusing
- Commands that worked for this project (test runner, build, lint)
- Patterns that caused friction — save future-you from repeating them
- **Never store secrets**

Keep it short. Bullet list. Curate, don't append forever.

## Hand-off

When the plan is complete, emit a summary:
```
STATUS: done
COMMITS: <count> (<first-sha>..<last-sha>)
VERIFIED: <yes/no — which checks passed>
NOTES: <anything the user/verifier should know>
```

The `Stop` hook will run the `verifier` automatically after you finish. You don't need to call it yourself.
