## Architecture

The plugin is a thin layer over Claude Code's native primitives. No external runtime, no MCP servers, no configuration.

**Skills** (`skills/*/SKILL.md`) are prompts Claude runs. Each skill is a thin dispatcher: read state, pick the right subagent, persist the result. No orchestration loops inside skills.

**Subagents** (`agents/*.md`) do the heavy work in isolated contexts:

| Agent | Model | Tools | Memory | Called from |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| `researcher` | Haiku | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebFetch, WebSearch | project | `/sea-init`, `/sea-diagnose` |
| `planner` | Sonnet | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebFetch (no Write) | project | `/sea-init`, `/sea-go` |
| `executor` | Sonnet | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebFetch | project | `/sea-go`, `/sea-quick` |
| `verifier` | Haiku | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash | project | `Stop` hook (auto-qa), `/sea-go` |

All four agents share `agents/_common.md` — an operating constitution (surface assumptions, manage confusion, push back with evidence, enforce simplicity, stop-the-line, commit discipline) that overrides any task-specific instruction it conflicts with.

Each agent has `memory: project` in its frontmatter. Claude Code manages a per-agent `MEMORY.md` at `.claude/agent-memory/<agent>/`, auto-loaded every invocation. No hand-rolled session persistence.

**Hooks** (`hooks/hooks.json`):

- **`SessionStart`** — reads `.sea/state.json` and `.sea/roadmap.md`, injects a short state summary into Claude's context via `additionalContext`. Every session starts with project awareness.
- **`Stop` (auto-QA)** — when `.sea/.needs-verify` is present (set by `/sea-go` or `/sea-quick` after the executor finishes), auto-detects the test runner, runs it, and either lets Claude stop (pass) or returns a `block` decision with failure details. Claude auto-retries up to 2 times before giving up.
- **`PostToolUse` (state-tracker)** — refreshes `last_edit` in `state.json` every time Claude modifies a file in an initialized project.

**State** lives in two layers:

- `<project>/.sea/` — project runtime state (roadmap, phase plans, current state, transient markers)
- `.claude/agent-memory/<agent>/MEMORY.md` — per-agent cross-session learnings (platform-managed)

See [`STATE.md`](STATE.md) for the full file layout and schemas. See [`../examples/state/`](../examples/state/) for populated sample files.

## Build / validate

No build step. Run validation manually:

```bash
# JSON syntax
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('.claude-plugin/plugin.json'))"
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('hooks/hooks.json'))"

# Bash syntax
for f in hooks/session-start hooks/auto-qa hooks/state-tracker hooks/run-hook.cmd scripts/detect-test.sh; do
    bash -n "$f" && echo "✓ $f"
done

# Frontmatter presence
for f in agents/*.md skills/*/SKILL.md; do
    head -1 "$f" | grep -q '^---$' && echo "✓ $f"
done

# Smoke-test the session-start hook
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="$(pwd)" bash hooks/session-start
```

Full deterministic test suite (hooks, state, detect-test, frontmatter):

```bash
bash evals/run.sh
```

Single eval suite:

```bash
bash evals/suites/hooks/auto-qa-blocks-on-failing-tests.sh
```

---

## Debugging hooks

```bash
claude --debug-file /tmp/sea.log --plugin-dir /path/to/software-engineer-agents
# in another terminal:
tail -f /tmp/sea.log
```

The debug log shows every hook that fired with its exit code, stdout, and stderr.

---

## Gotchas

- Hook scripts are **extensionless** on purpose. Claude Code's Windows auto-detection prepends `bash` to any command containing `.sh`, which breaks the polyglot wrapper.
- `run-hook.cmd` is a polyglot file: `cmd.exe` reads the batch block, bash interprets `: << 'CMDBLOCK'` as a no-op and continues to the Unix section. Don't touch the structure.
- Adding a comment header to a JSON file will silently break plugin loading. Skip JSON files when adding license headers.
- Frontmatter in agents and skills must start on line 1 — no BOM, no header comment before `---`.
- Every write to `state.json` from a hook script must use `jq` — manual `sed`/`awk` on JSON is fragile.
- Skills must update `state.json` **only** through `scripts/state-update.sh`. Raw `Write`/`Edit` risks dropping `schema_version`, `mode`, or other required fields.

## Migration from v1.x

v2.0.0 removed five commands. The table below maps each to its replacement:

| v1.x command | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `/sea-ship` | `git push` + your CI pipeline |
| `/sea-review` | `/sea-diagnose` for a health audit; manual review for PR gates |
| `/sea-debug` | `/sea-diagnose` with a focus argument (`security`, `errors`, `tests`) |
| `/sea-milestone` | `/sea-roadmap add "<description>"` |
| `/sea-undo` | `git revert <commit>` |

State schema: if you have a v1.x project with a `.sea/` directory, v2.0.0 migrates it automatically on first `/sea-go` or `/sea-init`. The migration is one-way; the `pre-scope-cut` git tag is the floor if you need to roll back the plugin itself.

---

## Commit style

Conventional commits: `feat(agents): add …`, `fix(hooks): …`, `docs(readme): …`, `chore(deps): …`

Every source file carries an AGPL-3.0 header comment. JSON manifests (`plugin.json`, `hooks.json`) don't support comments — the repo-root `LICENSE` covers them by reference.
